Mod-DTL_NSL-MoneyServer

This is an attempt to integrate the DTL and NSL money servers.

The primary focus is for the project to have all DTL functions *first*.
NSL functions may be commented out while DTL development completes.

REMEMBER:

OpenSimulator's money functions are limited.
Modification of OpenSim core may be required.

Patches will be provided when possible.

This is a work in progress.  Please lower your expectations.
